# Using predefined numbers instead of user input
num = 42  # First number
num2 = 7  # Second number

# Check if the second number is zero
if num2 == 0:
    print("Error: You cannot divide by zero.")  # Show an error message if it is zero
else:
    # Perform the division if num2 is not zero
    result = num / num2  
    # Print the result
    print(f"When {num} is divided by {num2}, the result is: {result}")
When 42 is divided by 7, the result is: 6.0
