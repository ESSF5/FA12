# Step 1: Set the year of birth and age
year_of_birth = 2008
age = 16

# Step 2: Double the birth year
doubled_year = year_of_birth * 2

# Step 3: Add 5 to the result
added_five = doubled_year + 5

# Step 4: Multiply by 50
multiplied_result = added_five * 50

# Step 5: Add the user's age
added_age = multiplied_result + age

# Step 6: Subtract 250
subtracted_result = added_age - 250

# Step 7: Divide by 100
final_result = subtracted_result / 100

# Step 8: Print the final result and interpretation
print(f"The final result is: {final_result}")
print("This number represents a unique calculation based on your birth year and age.")
The final result is: 2008.16
